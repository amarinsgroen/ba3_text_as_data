# Week 2 Deliverable: From Raw Text to Visual Patterns  
**Course:** Topical Reading: Digital Humanities (BA3 Korean Studies)  
**Date:** October 17  
**Instructors:** Aron van der Pol & Steven Denney

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Recreate the in-class **DEMO (Oct 17)** workflow to understand how preprocessing affects text representation and visualization in **Orange Data Mining (ODM)**.  

---

## 🧩 Tasks  

1. **Replicate the DEMO workflow**  
   - Import the provided `.csv` corpus.  
   - Apply basic preprocessing and other steps in ODM.  
   - Create a **Word Cloud** and a **Bar Chart of Word Frequencies**.  
   - For the bar chart, **select one word of personal or analytical interest** and explore its relative frequency.  

2. **Document your workspace**  
   - Screenshot your **Orange canvas** showing the full workflow:   
   - Screenshot or export both the **Word Cloud** and **Bar Chart** outputs.  

3. **Write your reflection (`README.md`)**  
   - Explain briefly what you did, why you did it, and what you learned about preprocessing and visualization.  
   - Around 200 words is fine. You can write more.
  
4. **Save your .ows file** (this is your ODM file/workflow).
