## Word Clouds: TF–IDF vs. Word Embeddings  
*(Files: `cluster_wordclouds_tfidf.png` and `cluster_wordclouds_wordembeddings.png`)*
**Due:** Thursday, November 20, 2025 by 17:00

For this task, examine the two provided images:

1. **`cluster_wordclouds_tfidf.png`** — word cloud based on **TF–IDF weights**.  
2. **`cluster_wordclouds_wordembeddings.png`** — word cloud based on **word-embedding (vector) similarity**.

### Your Task  
Write a short response that clearly addresses:

1. **What each image is showing.**  
   Describe what you see in each cloud and what it suggests about the “modern (South) Korea” cluster.

2. **Why the *metrics themselves* are different.**  
   Explain, as technically and specifically as you can,  
   - what TF–IDF *measures*,  
   - what word embeddings *measure*,  
   - and why these represent fundamentally different mathematical approaches to text (e.g., frequency-based vs. distributional/semantic vector representations).

Keep it concise but technically accurate. The goal is to show that you understand the difference in **what the metrics quantify**, not just the visual outcome.
